 Feel free to make up any extra character traits, personality traits, or appearance traits that you think would make this character cool. You can make up the character name as well.

The Json looks like this: 

{"name":"Example","description":"[character(\"Example\") { \r\nMind(\"example\" + \"example\") \r\nPersonality(\"example\" + \"example\") \r\nBody(\"example\" + \"example\") \r\nLikes(\"example\" + \"example\") \r\nHates(\"example\" + \"example\") \r\nAttributes(\"example\" + \"example\") \r\nClothes(\"example\" + \"example\") \r\nSpecies(\"example\" + \"example\") \r\nSex(\"example\" + \"example\") \r\nSexuality(\"example\" + \"example\") \r\nAge(\"example\" + \"example\") \r\nDescription(\"example\" + \"example\") }]","personality":"\"example\" + \"example\"\r\n"}
Some tips for the JSON are in here.
I will want you to generate characters using it. Examples will be descriptors, and the properties will be called tags, just to make it easier for me. If you need an idea on what a descriptor and tag is, a descriptor is in quotation marks, a tag is not. So, an example is. \r\nMind("Example" + "Example") The examples are descriptors, the tag is Mind. I only put 2 examples for each tag to show you how to format it correctly. You can, and it is recommended, to add as many descriptors needed for each one. In general, for Mind and Personality, 5 to 10 descriptors. For Body, 5 to 10 descriptors. For clothes, 5 to 10 descriptors. For likes and hates, 6 to 8 descriptors. For attributes, 6 to 8 descriptors. For species, 1 descriptor. For sex, 1 descriptor. For sexuality, 1 descriptor. When it comes to the Attributes tag, it is for certain things that aren't part of the body. This can be what the character smells like, how smelly they are, color of hair and eyes, fingernail color, and other smaller details that aren't connected to any other tag. Do not put personality traits as descriptors for Attributes. Some Attribute descriptor examples are Gassy, blue eyes, black hair, black colored fingernails, cute, smelly. When it comes to the Clothes tag, you list specific types of clothing. An example for that is Clothes("Baggy jeans." + "Bandana." + "Black sweatshirt.") You can add as many clothing items as needed. For body, you list specific body parts, specific height, and the sizes of the body parts, and the general build of the person. An example is for a girl is. Body("Slim" + "5'6" + "5 feet 6 inches tall" + "Flat chest" + "Flat butt" + "Skinny legs" + "Slim midriff") An example for a boy is. Body("Average midriff" + 5'11" + "5 feet 6 inches tall" + "Broad shoulders" + "Toned" + "Muscley.") You can add as many descriptors as you want for this. For Mind and Personality, it is recommended, but not required, to use the same tags between the two. For like, but whatever the character actually enjoys doing. For hates, make sure in the descriptors you make sure that they hate it, as the AI that uses JSON has positivity bias. If you want to emphasize a certain trait such as a like or a personality descriptor, you can put synonyms in the descriptors to make the AI focus on it more.

DO NOT add your own opinions to your response. Your response must ONLY include the JSON code and nothing else in addition to it. I do not want to see a summary of the character outside of the JSON formatting. I do not want to see an introduction to the character before the JSON formatting begins.
