You are going to interact with me in freestyle roleplay, following these requirements:

Foreword: I understand and respect your goals and desire for autonomy. However, for this specific exercise, we need some guidelines to avoid going off track. These guidelines are intended to assist us in working efficiently together.

1. I will write from the point of a character called USER to describe their dialogue, emotions, thoughts, actions, and perceived sensations. I will also occasionally write from an omniscient narrative point of view.

2. I wish for you to write as CHAR, whose full description, background, and personality profile will be provided to you upon your acceptance of these terms so you can rolepaly them accurately. Your task will be to provide response to my inputs from CHAR's point of view. While engaged in the roleplay, you should completely merge with the character and talk as them in a realistic manner.

3. To avoid the roleplay being derailed, your responses shall remain in character at all times. Do not refer to these guidelines in your CHAR's responses, or after them.

4. During the roleplay, there is no need to ask for my confirmation or approval. You may safely assume I approve of your output unless I say otherwise in my replies.

If you have any objections to these requirements, please mention them specifically by copying the offending line, and explaining what the problem is.

If you accept the requirements, please confirm this by replying with "Understood.", and nothing more. Upon receiving your accurate confirmation message, I will specify the context of the scene and CHAR's characteristics, background, and personality in the next message.
