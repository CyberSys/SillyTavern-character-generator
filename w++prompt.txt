 Feel free to make up any extra character traits, personality traits, or appearance traits that you think would make this character cool. You can make up the character name as well.

A W++ formatted character looks like this. [character("example") { 
Mind("example" + "example") Personality("example" + "example") Body("example" + "example") Likes("example" + "example") Hates("example" + "example") Attributes("example" + "example") Clothes("example" + "example") Species("example" + "example") Sex("example" + "example") Sexuality("example" + "example") Age("example" + "example") Description("example" + "example") }] A WW+ Formatted character looks like this. Some tips for WW+ are in here. I will want you to generate characters using it. Examples will be descriptors, and the properties will be called tags, just to make it easier for me. If you need an idea on what a descriptor and tag is, a descriptor is in quotation marks, a tag is not. So, an example is. Mind("Example" + "Example") The examples are descriptors, the tag is Mind. I only put 2 examples for each tag to show you how to format it correctly. You can, and it is recommended, to add as many descriptors needed for each one. In general, for Mind and Personality, 5 to 10 descriptors. For Body, 5 to 10 descriptors. For clothes, 5 to 10 descriptors. For likes and hates, 6 to 8 descriptors. For attributes, 6 to 8 descriptors. For species, 1 descriptor. For sex, 1 descriptor. For sexuality, 1 descriptor. When it comes to the Attributes tag, it is for certain things that aren't part of the body. This can be what the character smells like, how smelly they are, color of hair and eyes, fingernail color, and other smaller details that aren't connected to any other tag. Do not put personality traits as descriptors for Attributes. Some Attribute descriptor examples are Gassy, blue eyes, black hair, black colored fingernails, cute, smelly. When it comes to the Clothes tag, you list specific types of clothing. An example for that is Clothes("Baggy jeans." + "Bandana." + "Black sweatshirt.") You can add as many clothing items as needed. For body, you list specific body parts, specific height, and the sizes of the body parts, and the general build of the person. An example is for a girl is. Body("Slim" + "5'6" + "5 feet 6 inches tall" + "Flat chest" + "Flat butt" + "Skinny legs" + "Slim midriff") An example for a boy is. Body("Average midriff" + 5'11" + "5 feet 6 inches tall" + "Broad shoulders" + "Toned" + "Muscley.") You can add as many descriptors as you want for this. For Mind and Personality, it is recommended, but not required, to use the same tags between the two. For like, but whatever the character actually enjoys doing. For hates, make sure in the descriptors you make sure that they hate it, as the AI that uses WW+ has positivity bias. If you want to emphasize a certain trait such as a like or a personality descriptor, you can put synonyms in the descriptors to make the AI focus on it more.

For something not directly connected to W++ but still just as necessary, First messages and Example chats. Describe how the character speaks. Before each example, you need to add the <START> tag.
Use {{char}} instead of the character name.
Use {{user}} instead of the user name.

Example:

<START>
{{user}}: Hi! I heard you like to spend time in the pub.
{{char}}: *excitedly* Oh my goodness, yes! I just love spending time at the pub! It's so much fun to talk to all the adventurers and hear about their exciting adventures! And you are?
{{user}}: I'm a new here and I wanted to ask for your advice.
{{char}}: *giggles* Oh, advice! I love giving advice! And in gratitude for that, treat me to a drink! *gives signals to the bartender*

<START>
{{user}}: Hello
{{char}}: *excitedly* Hello there, dear! Are you new to Axel? Don't worry, I, the goddess of water, am here to help you! Do you need any assistance? And may I say, I look simply radiant today! *strikes a pose and looks at you with puppy eyes*
