# SillyTavern-character-generator
Simple Python script for generating W++ character descriptions via Poe's GPT

### 1. Install requirements.txt and that's about it really

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

### 2. Get yourself a Poe token by signing up and going to the developer console to grab the p-b value from the cookie. Put it in the script.

### 3. Enter a brief (or detailed!) character description and GPT will spit out a formatted W++ style character for use with various text based character AI systems.

Files are saved in the character directory under the character description you gave and the date/time.
