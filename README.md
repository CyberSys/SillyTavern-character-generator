# SillyTavern-character-generator
Simple Python script for generating W++ character descriptions via Poe's GPT

Install requirements.txt and that's about it really

Get yourself a Poe token by signing up and going to the devloper console to grab the p-b value from the cookie. Put it in the script.

Enter a brief (or detailed!) character description and GPT will spit out a formatted W++ style character for use with various text based character AI systems.

Files are saved in the character directory under the character description you gave.
