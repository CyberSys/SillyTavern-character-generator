# SillyTavern-character-generator
Simple Python script for generating W++ character descriptions via Poe's GPT

### 1. Install requirements.txt and that's about it really
 If you use on Windows first lounch start_windows.bat.
 Its will be get installed a runtime environment. But a first launch this got an err, when it wil be called a charGen.py, its is ok.
 Don't worry, just close it. Then run cmd_windows.bat and enter ths command:
`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 2. Get yourself a Poe token by signing up and going to the developer console to grab the p-b value from the cookie. Put it in the script.

### 3. Enter a brief (or detailed!) character description and GPT will spit out a formatted W++ style character for use with various text based character AI systems.

Files are saved in the character directory under the character description you gave and the date/time.
